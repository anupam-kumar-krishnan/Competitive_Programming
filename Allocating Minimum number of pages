/*
Given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages. Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. 
Example : 


Input : pages[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
        m = 2
Output : 113
Explanation:
There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed 
in following fashion : 
  1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 
      2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
  2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student
      2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages 
  3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 
      1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages

Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.
